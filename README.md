## About CommunitySchool
"There is often a significant communication gap between seniors who have excelled in their field and juniors within the same college. When juniors attempt to approach them, they may encounter delayed responses. 'CommunitySchool' is a web app where college students can ask questions and access resources, such as preparation strategies written by their peers. Additionally, anyone can post articles about preparation strategies."
